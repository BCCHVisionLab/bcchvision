# Welcome to the BC Children's Hospital Ophthalmology lab

The overarching goal of our research is to investigate the neural processes underlying the development of vision and visuomotor skills. We focus on the maturation of motion, depth and face perception, reading, attention and hand-eye coordination, as well as the effects of developmental disorders such as amblyopia (lazy eye) and dyslexia. Our research optimizes child-friendly psychophysics and neuroimaging techniques, including MEG and functional MRI, to understand differences in neurotypical and neurodiverse brain development in children and adults.
